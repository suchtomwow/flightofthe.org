		<h2>Day</h2>
		<p>I am currently a C++ developer for a small company in Topeka, KS. We write pharmacy software for prisons and universities. I work on a completely customized version of the prison software for the company&#39;s largest customer. This includes taking feature requests from the customer, writing the code, fixing bugs, and completely supporting the entire application. We use CodeGear (formerly Borland, now Embarcadero) RAD Studio C++Builder 2007 to do all development work and Microsoft SQL Server as the database server.</p>
		<p>Previously, I worked for the same company as an intern while in school and did mostly the same stuff. Before that, I was an IT helpdesk intern for the VA.</p>
		<h2>Night</h2>
		<p>In my free time, I write iOS apps. I&#39;m currently <a href="https://github.com/thomasjcarey/BLSNavigationController">working</a> on an app for reading and bookmarking websites with Pinboard. For my senior capstone in college, I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/thomasjcarey/taste">app</a> that uses Rdio and Last.fm&#39;s APIs to generate and listen to playlists based on a song.</p>
		<p>The <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">level</a> <a href="https://overcast.fm">of</a> <a href="http://vesperapp.co">quality</a> of apps in the App Store blows me away and inspires me to achieve the same level of quality in my own work. It is also what drives me write my own software in the first place. </p>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p><strong>Washburn University</strong> <em>(May 2013)</em></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Bachelor of Science - <em>Computer Information Science</em></li>
		<li>Bachelor of Arts - <em>Computer Information Systems</em></li>
		<li>Minors in Math &amp; Business</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I really started to get into computers in the 8th grade when I got a CD burner and started downloading music from Kazaa. This is when I first learned what a megabyte was as well as precisely how long it would take to download a song at 3.2 KB/s. From that point on, I was unstoppable. I dabbled in software and hardware for a couple years. built my own PC, and eventually picked up a couple C# programming books. I only got about half way through though, because really, who wants to write software to make arbitrary deposits into a fake bank account? So I decided I didn&#39;t like programming.</p>
		<p>I decided I wanted to become a network administrator, so I enrolled in college in the B.A. CIS program (less math and programming). Those pesky programming courses kept coming up, however, and after a couple years of wading through them, I enrolled in a Java data structures course in the Spring of 2011. It was this course that finally forced me to hunker down and really learn the stuff, and I fell in love. I came in knowing next to nothing, and left answering the questions of my peers.</p>
		<p>That fall I got an internship programming in C++, started learning Objective-C, and haven&#39;t looked back.</p>
